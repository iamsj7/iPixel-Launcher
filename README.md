## Vision

My launcher is a close to AOSP launcher that only changes the necessary code to allow for small extensions and backporting to older Android versions. If you want a more feature packed launcher use Nova, Action or Lawnchair.
It is focused on simplicity and rock solid stability.

## What is Launcher3?
Launcher3 is the name that the default AOSP launcher uses. If you compile AOSP from sources directly, that is what you will get. My GitHub project is called Pixel Home because I forked from AOSP and changed the Name. 

### How do I activate dark mode?
Set a very dark wallpaper. The threshold is an average brightness of 25% and there shouldn't be many bright spots.
or else toogle it in Theme Settings

### How do I uninstall this?
Select another launcher as your default, then you can uninstall it from your phone's settings app.

### How do I install this?
